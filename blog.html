        <h3>Assignment 1 - 10/2/2021</h3>
        <p>I did not encounter any problems with the first assignment as I had already used some basic HTML
            before, however, I did have to practice with Git and Github to understand them more. I learned how
            to use an image that is inside the directory, not just a URL (online). I knew the main commands and 
            about h1 through h6 already, but emphasizing text was new to me.
