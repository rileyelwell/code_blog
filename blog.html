        <h3>Assignment 1 - 10/2/2021</h3>
        <p>I did not encounter any problems with the first assignment as I had already used some basic HTML
            before, however, I did have to practice with Git and Github to understand them more. I learned how
            to use an image that is inside the directory, not just a URL (online). I knew the main commands and 
            about h1 through h6 already, but emphasizing text was new to me.
        </p>
        <h3>Assignment 2 - 10/25/2021</h3>
        <p>For this assignment, I found that finding the correct spacing and making sure the elements were alligned
            correctly was the most challenging. After going back thorugh some lecture notes and looking through
            sources such as css-tricks.com, I was able to understand some of the displays better (flex, inline-block, etc.).
            I learned how to add special 'effects' or properties when hovering over elements, and I became better at editing
            everything to do with fonts. I also found that the resizing of the images was a bit tricky (just following the mocks),
            but that there are a couple ways to resize and keep the desired resolution. As I mentioned earlier, I used css-tricks.com
            to help understand flex, but I also used GeeksforGeeks to get a better idea of resizing images and certain psuedothings
            for the buttons.
