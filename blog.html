        <h3>Assignment 1 - 10/2/2021</h3>
        <p>I did not encounter any problems with the first assignment as I had already used some basic HTML
            before, however, I did have to practice with Git and Github to understand them more. I learned how
            to use an image that is inside the directory, not just a URL (online). I knew the main commands and 
            about h1 through h6 already, but emphasizing text was new to me.
        </p>
        <h3>Assignment 2 - 10/25/2021</h3>
        <p>For this assignment, I found that finding the correct spacing and making sure the elements were alligned
            correctly was the most challenging. After going back thorugh some lecture notes and looking through
            sources such as css-tricks.com, I was able to understand some of the displays better (flex, inline-block, etc.).
            I learned how to add special 'effects' or properties when hovering over elements, and I became better at editing
            everything to do with fonts. I also found that the resizing of the images was a bit tricky (just following the mocks),
            but that there are a couple ways to resize and keep the desired resolution. As I mentioned earlier, I used css-tricks.com
            to help understand flex, but I also used GeeksforGeeks to get a better idea of resizing images and certain psuedothings
            for the buttons.
        </p>
        <h3>Assignment 3 - 11/8/2021</h3>
        <p>To start, this was defienietely the hardest assignment out of the three. With that being said, I think I learned the
            most (out of the three assignments) and feel like a much better web designer. The ability to add functionality to
            buttons, filters, and user inputs is a very good tool to have. Obviously, it is only client-side at the moment, but 
            I know that we will cover more later on. The hardest part of the assignment was making sure the filters could re-filter
            and that they all worked together (while also dispalying all the posts in the correct order). Eventually, I figured out
            a way to accomplish this, but I am sure there are other methods too. Also, I did use various online sources to find certain
            helpful commands or "attributes" such as .indexOf(), .includes(), and .push(). Learning about these to make a functional
            website is pretty cool and I hope that I can keep expanding my web development knowledge.
        </p>
        <h3>Assignment 4 - 11/15/2021</h3>
        <p>This assignment was fairly simple, compared to the previous one. I understand the status code calls and the http
            requests/responses better now. I struggled a little at first when implementing the picture as it was not showing up correctly.
            However, I relaized I was reading the file as a character-set, so that is why. I fixed this and then I had a little trouble making
            sure all the files were only read once, as I did not see this requirement at first. I made sure to read each file only once and
            set their contents to variables in memory. I checked by using console.log to print whenever it was called. For the other part, I 
            essentially just used conditionals to check for the url and then display the correct page accordingly. It worked, and then I was 
            able to dispaly the 404 correctly when there was no page for it. Overall, the assignment was shorter and I liked it because 
            it helped me to get a better understanding of status codes, the process for creating a server, making it listen, and then sending
            correct repsonses for what it should be.
