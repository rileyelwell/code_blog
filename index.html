        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>When I was in high school, I was a part of our robotics team, and 
                I maintained the website with mostly HTML and CSS. This is the extent
            of my web development skills.</li>
            <li>From this class I hope to learn how to properly code a website that functions well and looks appealing.</li>
            <li>Yes, I have signed up for the class Campuswire!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Interesting Story</h3>
        <p>The most interesting experience I have had is probably competing in a Hackathon-type event with some other 
            friends from my high school. We placed and were invited to go to the California State Capitol Building in 
            Sacramento. We were able to tour the building, watch a voting session, and meet state assembly makers.
        Overall, it was a very cool experience to visit the Capitol and see how it runs on a daily basis.</p>
